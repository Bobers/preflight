- [x] **Frontend Sorting**: Risk level sorting handled in frontend, not backend
- [x] **No Input Filtering**: Let AI handle any input, return empty array for nonsense
- [x] **Mobile Responsive**: Vertical stacking layout for mobile devices

### Testing Scenarios
- [x] Test with 100-character minimum input
- [x] Test with 10,000-character maximum input
- [x] Test with business plans containing no assumptions
- [x] Test with nonsense/random text input
