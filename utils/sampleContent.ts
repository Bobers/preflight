export const sampleBusinessPlan = `TechStart - SaaS Business Plan Executive Summary

We're launching a revolutionary AI-powered project management tool that will capture 10% of the $5B project management software market within 2 years. Our proprietary algorithm guarantees 50% productivity improvements for all teams.

Market Analysis
The project management software market is growing at 15% annually. All existing solutions are outdated and users are desperately waiting for our product. We've identified that 90% of companies are dissatisfied with current tools based on our survey of 50 startup founders in our network.

Product
Our AI automatically manages projects without human input. It assigns tasks, sets deadlines, and resolves conflicts. Beta users report it's "like having a senior PM who never sleeps." The technology is so advanced that competitors won't be able to replicate it for at least 5 years.

Go-to-Market Strategy
We'll acquire our first 1,000 customers through LinkedIn outreach, expecting a 25% conversion rate. Our viral referral program will drive 10x growth monthly. Enterprise clients will naturally discover us and sign 6-figure annual contracts without a sales team.

Financial Projections
- Year 1: $1M revenue (1,000 customers @ $100/month)
- Year 2: $15M revenue (15x growth from viral marketing)
- Year 3: $100M revenue (enterprise adoption)

Our burn rate will stay under $50K/month as we'll primarily hire remote contractors. We expect to be profitable by month 8.

Team
Our founding team of 2 engineers from top tech companies will build the entire platform in 3 months. We'll hire our first salesperson only after reaching $5M ARR. Customer support will be handled entirely by our AI chatbot.

Funding
Seeking $500K pre-seed funding for 10% equity. This will provide 18 months runway, though we expect to be profitable much sooner. We anticipate raising Series A at $100M valuation within 12 months.`;
