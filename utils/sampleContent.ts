Executive Summary
We're opening The Big Bowl, a premium bowling alley that will capture 30% of the local entertainment market within 18 months. Our unique combination of craft bowling, artisanal food, and vintage atmosphere will generate $2M annual revenue by year two.

Market Analysis
The local entertainment market is worth $8M annually and growing 12% per year. All existing bowling alleys are outdated with terrible food and no atmosphere. Everyone in our focus group of 25 friends said they'd definitely come here at least twice a month.

Revenue Streams
- Lane rentals: $45/hour (customers will gladly pay premium for quality)
- Food & beverages: $25 average per person (artisanal everything commands higher prices)
- Private events: $2,000 per event (corporate clients love unique venues)
- Merchandise: $15 average per customer

Competitive Advantage
We'll be the only upscale bowling experience in a 50-mile radius. Our vintage 1970s theme with authentic wood lanes will create an Instagram-worthy experience that generates massive organic marketing. Customers will drive from neighboring cities just to bowl here.

Financial Projections
- Month 1-6: 500 customers monthly, $50,000 revenue
- Month 7-12: 1,500 customers monthly, $120,000 revenue  
- Year 2: 3,000 customers monthly, $200,000 revenue
- Break-even by month 9

Operations Plan
We'll operate with just 3 full-time staff plus part-time help. Customers will mostly serve themselves using our innovative self-service system. Maintenance costs will be minimal since quality equipment never breaks down.

Funding Requirements
Seeking $750K to build out the space and purchase 12 vintage lanes. This covers all equipment, renovation, and 12 months operating expenses. We expect to be cash flow positive within 9 months, so this is all the funding we'll ever need.`;
