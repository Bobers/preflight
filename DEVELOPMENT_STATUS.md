## ðŸ“Š Progress Summary

- **Total Tasks**: ~150
- **Completed**: ~130 (87%)
- **Remaining**: ~20 (13%)

Most of the remaining tasks involve:
1. Setting up external services (OpenAI, Upstash, Vercel)
2. User testing with real users
3. Production deployment and monitoring

The application is fully functional and ready for deployment once the external services are configured.
